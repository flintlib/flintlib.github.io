# FLINT development workshop in Palaiseau, October 2025

## When and where

* October 27 -- 31, 2025
* Bâtiment Alan Turing, campus de l'École polytechnique, Palaiseau, France
  ([location](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=48.71441&mlon=2.20540#map=18/48.71441/2.20540))
  * Mon–Tue : Gilles Kahn room (ground floor)

* We plan to start around 09:00 on Monday and end between 12:00 and 17:00 on
  Friday. Feel free to arrive later or leave earlier.

## Program

The workshop will focus on coding sprints to develop FLINT and improve FLINT's
integration in other software.  Developers of other mathematical software with
no direct link to FLINT are also very welcome.

Depending on participant interest, we may arrange a small number of tutorials
and technical talks.  Feel free to reach out to the organizers with
presentation proposals or suggestions for topics you'd like to see covered.

Additional informal talks and public discussions will be scheduled as the need
arises.

## Local information

### Access

* [Access and mobility on campus](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/access-and-mobility-campus)
* [Route planner](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en)

### Where to stay

* [Aparthotel Adagio Access Palaiseau Saclay](https://www.adagio-city.com/fr/hotel-a0x3-apparthotel-adagio-access-palaiseau-saclay.shtml)
  is just around the corner (but the neighborhood is a bit lifeless and it takes
  some time to get out of it).
* Many hotels in Massy, ~20 min from Polytechnique by bus (line 4606 or 5154
  from Massy Palaiseau to Place Marguerite Perey; better option if you want to
  go to Paris in the evenings.
* [Hôtel d'Orsay](https://www.orsay-hotel.com/) is located close to Le Guichet
  RER station, 30--40 min from Polytechnique by foot via Passage du Buisson aka
  escaliers de la Troche (300+ stairs), or ~30 min by bus (9105 or 4606 from
  Gare du Guichet to Place Marguerite Perey).

### Where to eat

* In the immediate vicinity of Polytechnique: Le 19, Le Living-Room
  (restaurants), Food Asia Saclay 91 (Asian fast food), Panifique (bakery,
  closes at 20:00)
* Just a little further: Mangia, Le Julie's.
* Massy: many restaurants and fast-food options on both sides of
  Massy-Palaiseau RER station, most decent, none exceptional
* A few restaurants close to Le Guichet station.
* Many more options in Palaiseau (rue de Paris) or Orsay but not as easy to
  reach.
